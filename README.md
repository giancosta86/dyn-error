_Macros for dynamic errors_

[![CI](https://github.com/giancosta86/dyn-error/actions/workflows/publish-to-crates.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/giancosta86/dyn-error/actions/workflows/publish-to-crates.yml)

This crate provides error-related utility macros.

In particular, its core feature resides in the automatic implementation of a wide range of
_equality checks_ via the `impl_err_equality!` macro, which is especially useful in documentation examples as well as in testing.
